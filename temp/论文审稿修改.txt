# 实验方面
1. 实验结果与结论矛盾
2. 缺少关键支撑
3. poor discussion
    R1-3-8/9/
    R1-3-11

    R2-3-1 (one less gaussian ? One more?  number of Gaussians to fit to approximately matches the number of chromophores? Why using gaussian to fit chromophore concentration)



2. 写作
2.1 不清晰的定义

R1-3-1， R1-3-2 (FID, 补充解释为什么只用FID，SSID那种为什么不用)
R1-3-4
R2-3-2 (not include period of time)

R3-3-2/3 (highlight X%)

highlight fairness (for dark skintone)

R3-3-4 (change a sample)
R3-3-10 (COLOR Colour calibrated?)

2.2 细节缺失
R1-3-5 (unknown scale, ICA截断)
R1-3-7 (EQUATION)
2.3 Related works
R1-3-3
R1-3-12 (EXPLANATION)

R2-3-3 (how to choose / tune  hyper parameters)

R3-3-1 (lack of discussion to related works about modelling: other applications, and say they are not suitable to our application)
R3-3-5/7/8 (Methods section presents one paper on physics based modelling that is selected from 2006. Hasn't there been any progress in the domain since? Related Works section should discuss and cover a greater survey of the SOTA in all the categories that resemble or have inspired this work. )
(More recent methods. Or say why recent methods not suitable)
R3-3-12 (WHY CHOOSE THOSE COMPETTING METHODS)

R3-3-16 (OPEN DATASET?)

2.4 Typor
R1-3-6
R3-3-6


R4-3-1/2/3
