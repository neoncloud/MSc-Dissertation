\section{One}

The last chapter is always the Conclusion. This generally should have three parts. The first is a concise summary of the work you have done. In a way, this is similar to the abstract. Then there is the conclusion, in which you highlight the significance of the results, and perhaps the consequences of the results, critically where necessary. The last thing is usually recommendations and/or future work, in which you identify the inadequacies of what you have done, and suggest how the gaps may be plugged.

\section{Two}

Documents that are prepared with the help of other sources should have a list of sources cited. A list of References contains only sources the writer quotes directly, takes original ideas from, and refers to in the dissertation should be included. In reports where the subject is primarily scientific, the list of references is the most widely accepted way to cite specific sources.
