Put your abstracts here. The Abstract should be a short and concise passage on the important work and contributions of the project: the motivation and the problem pursued, the method you employed and the results obtained, highlighting the significant achievements. It should not contain peripheral things like summary of literature review, and it is not good enough to say that a certain issue has been studied without stating the results of the study. Generally, one page is about the right length for the Abstract.
