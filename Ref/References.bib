    abstract = {We present a novel spectral shading model for human skin. Our model accounts for both subsurface and surface scattering, and uses only four parameters to simulate the interaction of light with human skin. The four parameters control the amount of oil, melanin and hemoglobin in the skin, which makes it possible to match specific skin types. Using these parameters we generate custom wavelength dependent diffusion profiles for a two-layer skin model that account for subsurface scattering within the skin. These diffusion profiles are computed using convolved diffusion multipoles, enabling an accurate and rapid simulation of the subsurface scattering of light within skin. We combine the subsurface scattering simulation with a Torrance-Sparrow BRDF model to simulate the interaction of light with an oily layer at the surface of the skin. Our results demonstrate that this four parameter model makes it possible to simulate the range of natural appearance of human skin including African, Asian, and Caucasian skin types.},

The challenge of rendering human skin is further complicated by some technical issues such as the fact that skin is a highly detailed surface with noticeable features in the order of ~100 microns and the fact that skin is translucent.

    abstract = {We introduce a layered, heterogeneous spectral reflectance model for human skin. The model captures the inter-scattering of light among layers, each of which may have an independent set of spatially-varying absorption and scattering parameters. For greater physical accuracy and control, we introduce an infinitesimally thin absorbing layer between scattering layers. To obtain parameters for our model, we use a novel acquisition method that begins with multi-spectral photographs. By using an inverse rendering technique, along with known chromophore spectra, we optimize for the best set of parameters for each pixel of a patch. Our method finds close matches to a wide variety of inputs with low residual error.We apply our model to faithfully reproduce the complex variations in skin pigmentation. This is in contrast to most previous work, which assumes that skin is homogeneous or composed of homogeneous layers. We demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of our model by creating complex skin visual effects such as veins, tattoos, rashes, and freckles, which would be difficult to author using only albedo textures at the skin's outer surface. Also, by varying the parameters to our model, we simulate effects from external forces, such as visible changes in blood flow within the skin due to external pressure.},

Previous work on diffusion in translucent materials has assumed smooth semi-infinite homogeneous materials and solved for the scattering of light using a dipole diffusion approximation. This approximation breaks down in the case of thin translucent slabs and multi-layered materials. We present a new efficient technique based on multiple dipoles to account for diffusion in thin slabs. We enhance this multipole theory to account for mismatching indices of refraction at the top and bottom of of translucent slabs, and to model the effects of rough surfaces. To model multiple layers, we extend this single slab theory by convolving the diffusion profiles of the individual slabs. We account for multiple scattering between slabs by using a variant of Kubelka-Munk theory in frequency space. Our results demonstrate diffusion of light in thin slabs and multi-layered materials such as paint, paper, and human skin.},

    abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

                    Abstract
                    Simulating the effects of skincare products on the face is a potential new mode for product self-promotion while facilitating consumers to choose the right product. Furthermore, such simulations enable one to anticipate her skin condition and better manage skin health. However, there is a lack of effective simulations today. In this paper, we propose the first simulation model to reveal facial pore changes after using skincare products. Our simulation pipeline consists of two steps: training data establishment and facial pore simulation. To establish training data, we collect face images with various pore quality indexes from short-term (8-weeks) clinical studies. People experience significant skin fluctuations (due to natural rhythms, external stressors, etc.,) which introduce large perturbations, and we propose a sliding window mechanism to clean data and select representative index(es) to present facial pore changes. The facial pore simulation stage consists of 3 modules: UNet-based segmentation module to localize facial pores; regression module to predict time-dependent warping hyperparameters; and deformation module, taking warping hyperparameters and pore segmentation labels as inputs, to precisely deform pores accordingly. The proposed simulation renders realistic facial pore changes. This work will pave the way for future research in facial skin simulation and skincare product developments.

  abstract = {The present paper describes a method for modeling human skin coloring and estimating the surface-spectral reflectance by using the Kubelka-Munk theory. First, human skin is modeled as two layers of turbid materials. Second, we describe the reflectance estimation problem as the Kubelka-Munk equations with unknown six parameters. These parameters are the regular reflectance at skin surface and the five weights for spectral absorption of such different pigments as melanin, carotene, oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin, and bilirubin. Moreover, the optical coefficients of spectral absorption and scattering for the two skin layers and the thickness values of these layers are used for the solution. Finally, experiments are done for estimating the skin surface-spectral reflectance on some body parts, such as the cheeks of human face, the palm, the backs of hand, the inside of arm, and the outside of arm. It is confirmed that the proposed method is more reliable in all cases.},

  abstract = {We have examined the quantity and composition of melanin in both photoprotected (volar upper arm) and chronically photoexposed (dorsal forearm) skin from a range of different ethnic skin types including African, Indian, Mexican, Chinese and European. The most lightly pigmented (European, Chinese and Mexican) skin types have approximately half as much epidermal melanin as the most darkly pigmented (African and Indian) skin types. However, the composition of melanin in these lighter skin types is comparatively more enriched with lightly coloured, alkali-soluble melanin components (up to three-fold). Regardless of ethnicity, epidermal melanin content is significantly greater in chronically photoexposed skin than it is in corresponding photoprotected skin (up to two-fold). However, by comparison there is only a modest enrichment of lightly coloured, alkali soluble melanin components in photoprotected skin (up to 1.3-fold). Analysis of melanosomes extracted from the epidermis in these subjects indicates that the proportion of spheroidal melanosomes is low in all skin types examined ({$<$}10\%). This suggests that in human skin, pheomelanin is a very minor component of epidermal melanin, even in the lightest (European) skin types. Analysis of melanosome size revealed a significant and progressive variation in size with ethnicity: African skin having the largest melanosomes followed in turn by Indian, Mexican, Chinese and European. On the basis of these findings, we propose that variation in skin pigmentation is strongly influenced by both the amount and the composition (or colour) of the melanin in the epidermis. Variation in melanosome size may also play a significant role. However, the data also suggest that in human skin there are subtle differences in the mechanisms associated with the maintenance of constitutive pigmentation and facultative hyperpigmentation, respectively.},
